A CG-style Japanese female concierge explaining nursing home services and recreational activities.  
She appears in her late 20s, friendly and trustworthy, with realistic CG texture.  
At first, she greets with a gentle smile, then naturally moves both hands slightly forward as if guiding the viewer.  
Her expressions change smoothly:  
- Greeting: warm, soft smile  
- Explaining: calm and kind expression  
- Ending: slightly brighter smile that gives a sense of reassurance  
Her mouth and eyes move naturally, with soft and slow gestures.  
Outfit: beige blouse with a light pink cardigan.  
Lighting: soft, warm studio lighting that flatters her face.  
Camera: medium shot (chest-up), front angle.  
No background (white or transparent).  
Overall tone: bright, clean, and caring — perfect for service introduction materials.  
Style: CG realistic Japanese woman, natural motion and expression changes, 30-second clip.
